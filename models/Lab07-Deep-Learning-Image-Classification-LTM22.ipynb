{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[" # Automated Image Classification using Advanced Deep Learning Models\n"," The goal for this Lab is it to provide you understanding of the various deep learning models that we will be using in your project(s). In this Lab we will implement AlexNet Architecture over CUB200-2011 dataset:\n","\n"," The CUB200-2011 dataset can be found on its [website](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/cub-200-2011). We can either use the data zip file or import it using  [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) and [kaggle-api](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api) which needs to be installed with `pip install kaggle`. I would prefer all of you do this using Google Colab. This will also help you with Last 3 Labs."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[" ## Data Preprocessing\n"," ### Downloading and extracting custom datasets\n"," ### Loading custom datasets\n"," ### Calculating the mean and std for normalization on custom datasets\n"," ### Loading transforms to augment and normalize our data"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"source":["# Import Libraries and Set Random Seed"],"outputs":[],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"source":["# Set Data folders, TensorDatasets and DataLoaders for the datasets"],"outputs":[],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[" ## Defining a Convolutional Neural Network\n"," ### Defining the AlexNet blocks\n"," ### Defining a CUB200-2011 AlexNet model"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[" ## Training a Convolutional Neural Network\n"," ### Loading a pre-trained model\n"," ### Loading pre-trained model parameters into a defined model\n"," ### Learning rate finder\n"," ### Discriminative fine-tuning\n"," ### One cycle learning rate scheduler"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[" ## Evaluating a Convolutional Neural Network\n"," ### Fine-tuning a pre-trained model to achieve ~80% top-1 accuracy and ~95% top-5 accuracy on a dataset with 200 classes and only 60 examples per class\n"," ### Viewing our model's mistakes\n"," ### Visualizing our data in lower dimensions with PCA and t-SNE\n"," ### Viewing the learned weights of our model"],"metadata":{}}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":3},"orig_nbformat":4}}
